# C++
dynamic array: an implementation of dynamic array

word wrap: wordWrap can take a single argument on the command line, a positive integer
denoting the width of the line. If no argument is supplied on the command line, the width is
25. wordWrap takes a sequence of words on stdin and echoes them to stdout, such that the
width of the output is no wider than the provided command-line argument.

word wrap augmented: enhance word wrap by accepting a second optional command-line option,
which will be the name of a file.
